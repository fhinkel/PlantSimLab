This is a testsuite to check any changes in the code against pre-existing .dot
files. 

The pregenerated .dot files are named istoch.dot and idep.dot. 
The testsuite script runs the runner script to generate the files, using
filei.txt as input file and runs a diff on pregenerated and new files

Attention: testsuite does not check the webinterface or new_dvd2.pl at all!
